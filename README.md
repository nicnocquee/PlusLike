## What is this?
Just my first try writing Chrome extension.

## What does it do?
This extenstion adds Facebook's "Like" button to each post on your Google+ stream.

## Why not publish in Chrome webstore?
I tried to. But apparently Google Checkout sucks. You see, I was asked to pay $5 to publish app/extension. But everytime I tried to pay, it kept failing. So I got tired of trying and decided to just put it here.

## How to install?
Check out the 4th step of **Create and load extension** section in the [Chrome Extenstion's Get Started](http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/getstarted.html) page.

## Your code's ugly!
I know! It's my first time writing Chrome extension, so please spare me. I'd greatly appreciate if you can help me write better code :)

## It doesn't work!
Sorry for you, but I didn't test this extension anywhere else but my machine and it works! I did this just for fun! FYI, I'm using Chrome browser version 14.0.835.163 in Mac OS X Lion version 10.7.1.
